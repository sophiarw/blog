# The Lessons of History by Will and Ariel Durant

## Summary
Will and Ariel Durant are historians who, throughout their careers, synthesized the main trends and insights of history. Each chapter reads like an essay whose thesis describe's a particular attribute of man and is supported using historical examples. The authors contend that these attributes of man are invariable and will persist in future generations. I would say their argument has merit: the book was written in 1964, before the age of the internet, but many of their observations still hold true. 

## Audiobook
I listened to the audiobook. The audiobook contained interviews with the author that influenced how I interpreted the material in the chapters. The author's answered questions that clarify their more controversial points. If it's your first time reading the book I would recommend the paper version.

## Impressions
With the bombardment of information on the internet, it's easy to forget events even from last week. In the end, a lot of the information is useless. Each story or article is a single narrative that does not offer the complexity of generations. We forget history. 

I am motivated by the idea of a better world and I have some ideas about what that world should be like. But often those ideas are based on feelings, not facts. I liked this book because it showed me logical hypothesis about the nature of man based on historical events. Did I like all of the hypothesis? No.

The chapter of Race and History was particularly distressing. The authors present the idea that the intermingling of races has historically lead to the demise of nations. This is alarming given the current mixing pot in the US and in other nations around the world. However, they're claim intrigues me. I want to know more so that I can learn from the lessons of history and think critically about what is needed for a different future.

## Notes by Chapter
1. **Histories:** History is always interpreted by those who tell it.
2. **History of the Earth:** Certain geographies are correlated with successful groups/technology. Civilizations success on rivers (Egypt) preceded their success on bodies of water (Mediterranean). Then civilizations were successful on oceans (England and Spain). Defines history “Let us define history, in its troublesome duplexity, as the events or record of the past. (Pg 13)”
3. **Biology and History** "... The first biological lesson of history is that Life is competition". We collaborate so that we can compete better against other groups. "The second biological lesson is that life is selection." We select for intelligence or physical prowess and the world is consequently always unequal. “Economic development specializes functions, differentiates abilities, and makes men unequally valuable to their group.” "... third... is that life must breed." How does who is having babies change the makeup, and consequently the motivations, of a civilization?
4. **Race and History.** Points out that intermingling of races has historically led to the demise of nations. When groups mingle, they create a new group with its own culture, morals, etc. 
5. **Character and History.** "“known history shows little alteration in the conduct of mankind.” Variations are attributed to "imitation, custom, and education"
6. **Morals and History.** Morals differ with environment and culture, but exist in all cultures. His evidence is the changes that resulted from the hunting, agricultural, and Industrial Ages. Hunting: men died hunting to survive so multiple women for one man. Agriculture: Children are assets, birth control is immoral. Equal men and women means monogamy. Industry: More need for labor leads to female equality so more women enter the workforce. Children no longer assists in production so marriage postponed. In current society: Is there moral decay or are there changes that will lead to a new moral code?
7. **Religion and History.** Religion existed to provide reason for state decrees and to teach morals. Can we have morals without religion? There is no historical evidence that this is possible. "'There will be religion as long as there is poverty.'(p. 76)"
8. Economics and History. "Concentration of wealth inevitable." Leads to distribution of wealth through policy or revolution.
9.  **Socialism and History.** There exists an inevitable push and pull between socialism and capitalism because each at its own extreme brews dissatisfaction.
10. **Government and History.** The government's task is to maintain order. Monarchy has been the most common form of government. Modern democracy has resulted in the best outcome for a civilization.
11. **History and War.** "In the last 3,421 years of recorded history only 268 have seen no war.” History tells us there is no end to war except if one nation has enough power to dictate the behavior of all nations, thus creating peace (Rome).
12. **Growth and Decay.** All civilizations end.
13. **Is Progress real?** It depends how you define progress. We do have the chance to use past knowledge for our benefit and pass on the knowledge we have accrued.
